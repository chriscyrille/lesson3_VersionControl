            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems, or VCS, is a system that archives changes to a file, or set of files, so that specific versions can be recalled later. It provides control to any changes in a source code. These changes are usually put in number or letter form to make it easier for recall. Revision control is already in many software that we use today like word processors and spreadsheets. The different revisions allow the author, and others, to track edits, compare versions, and even make corrections to any mistakes. This type of technology is vital for the organization of multi-developer assignments.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system (VCS) that is primarily used for software development but can work with a variety of files. It tracks changes in computer files as well as organizes work on those files between many people. The development of Git began in April of 2005. Linus Torvalds created it because he wanted that he could use like Bitkeeper, which was a system that was used before to maintain projects. The name git came about because Torvalds felt that he was an ‘egotistical bastard’ and that he names all of his projects after himself. In British English slang git means unpleasant person.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two groups of version control systems and they serve different needs. They are Centralized Version Control Systems and Distributed Version Control Systems. Centralized Version Control Systems have a central system where changes could be made and permits developers to cooperate on additional systems. These systems are easy to set up but developers will not be able to save changes if the main server breaks down. Distributed Version Control Systems, on the other hand, do not rely on a central network. Developers clone the repository and have the project in their hard drive. Without a remote server to access, work gets done quicker. Though work can get done quicker, changes to a file work be harder to track.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are basic commands in git for programmers and developers to become familiar with. To create a new repository the user must create a directory and perform the ‘git init’ function. For using a local repository or accessing it remotely there are different commands. ‘git clone /path/to/repository’ makes a working copy to work locally, and ‘git clone username@host:/path/to/repository’ is used when using a remote server. Add and Commit commands are used to propose changes and actually commit to the changes. ‘git add <filename>’ followed by ‘git add *’ are the first steps in git workflow. ‘git commit -m "Commit message"’ is used to commit the changes. Lastly, the changes must get pushed to the remote repository using ‘git push origin master’.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local and Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The differences between a local and remote repository is in the Distributed Version Control System. The local repository has identical features as the other git repository. That means that the git repository on the server and on github are the same. There is no central repository that dictates any changes. You can make changes on your machine without internet connection. Later, when an internet connection is achieved the changes can be pushed to other git repositories that you have access to. The user is committing to the local repository when working remotely. Then, changes are sent to a remote repository by pushing them.</p>
